# 2 - Compound Components

## Background

Compound components are components that work together to form a complete UI. The
classic example of this is <select> and <option> in HTML:

```html
<select>
  <option value="1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="2">Option 2</option>
</select>
```

The `<select>` is the element responsible for managing the state of the UI, and
the `<option>` elements are essentially more configuration for how the select
should operate (specifically, which options are available and their values).

## Exercise

In this example, people want to use the Toggle the same way they can use a
select. We have a Toggle component that manages the state, and we want to render
different parts of the UI however we want. We want control over the presentation
of the UI.

ðŸ¦‰ The fundamental challenge you face with an API like this is the state shared
between the components is implicit, meaning that the developer using your
component cannot actually see or interact with the state (`on`) or the
mechanisms for updating that state (`toggle`) that are being shared between the
components.

So in this exercise, we'll solve that problem by providing the compound
components with the props they need implicitly using `React.cloneElement`.

Here's a simple example of using `React.Children.map` and `React.cloneElement`:

```javascript
function Foo({children}) {
  return React.Children.map(children, (child, index) => {
    return React.cloneElement(child, {
      id: `i-am-child-${index}`,
    })
  })
}

function Bar() {
  return (
    <Foo>
      <div>I will have id "i-am-child-0"</div>
      <div>I will have id "i-am-child-1"</div>
      <div>I will have id "i-am-child-2"</div>
    </Foo>
  )
}
```

## Extra Credit

### ðŸ’¯ Support non-toggle children

Try updating the `Usage` to this:

```javascript
function Usage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Toggle onToggle={(...args) => console.info('onToggle', ...args)}>
        <Toggle.On>The button is on</Toggle.On>
        <Toggle.Off>The button is off</Toggle.Off>
        <span>Hello</span>
        <Toggle.Button />
      </Toggle>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Notice the error message in the console and try to fix it.

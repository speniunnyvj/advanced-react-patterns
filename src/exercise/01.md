# Context

## Background

The reason redux got so popular was because it enabled people to side-step
[Prop Drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling) pain thanks to its
use of the context API which was experimental at the time it was released.

The context API has since been made official, so the provider pattern is
built-into React as a first class feature. React's context API is a
fundamentally critical part to any sizeable React Application. The API itself is
quite simple:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const Foo = React.createContext()

function FooValue() {
  const fooContextValue = React.useContext(Foo)
  return <div>{fooContextValue}</div>
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Foo.Provider value="hello">
    <FooValue />
  </Foo.Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)

// this renders: <div>hello</div>
```

The idea here is that you can implicitly pass state around a branch of your
React component tree (or the entire tree as in the example above) without having
to manually pass that state around via props.

## Exercise

There are some good ways to use the React context API to improve the
maintainability of your app and that's what this exercise is all about. In this
exercise, we're going to imagine we have a user settings page where we render a
form for the user's information. We'll be storing the user's information in
context and we'll follow some patterns for exposing ways to keep that context
updated as well as interacting with the backend.

> ðŸ’° In this exercise, if you enter the text "fail" in the tagline or biography
> input, then the "backend" will reject the promise so you can test the error

The form is all written out for you. Your job will be to implement the context
module which exports a `UserProvider` component and a `UserContext` function.

From here you should be good to go to follow the instructions from the emoji.
Note that there are a few ways to accomplish this one and feel free to
experiment a bit. It'll help your learning and retention to struggle with this.

> That's how we'll implement it in the end.

ðŸ“œ If you need to review the context API, here are the docs:

- https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html
- https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext

ðŸ¦‰ Tip: You may notice that the context provider/consumers in React DevTools
just display as `Context.Provider` and `Context.Consumer`. That doesn't do a
good job differentiating itself from other contexts that may be in your app.
Luckily, you can set the context `displayName` and it'll display that name for
the `Provider` and `Consumer`. Hopefully in the future this will happen
automatically ([learn more](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/11241)).

```javascript
const MyContext = React.createContext()
MyContext.displayName = 'MyContext'
```

## Extra Credit

### ðŸ’¯ export hooks

Exporting your context object itself is fine, but one of the cool things about
hooks is that we can compose them and make our own. This allows you to do a
little extra work in your own hook and benefit from that extra work everywhere
you use that custom hook. For example, if someone were trying to consume our
User context value without first wrapping components in a `UserProvider` first,
they'd get a cryptic error message about not being able to destructure `user`
from `undefined`. You can learn more about these benefits in
[How to use React Context effectively](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively).

For this extra credit, create your own hook called `useUser` that consumes the
`UserContext` value using `React.useContext` and if that value is undefined it
should throw a useful error indicating that `useUser` can only be used within a
`UserProvider`.

### ðŸ’¯ separate contexts

Context is definitely an area where re-renders can be a problem. Especially if
there are many consumers. So we want to avoid triggering re-renders as much as
possible. React will re-render all consumers any time the value you pass to the
`value` prop changes. Luckily for us, the `dispatch` function we get back from
`useReducer` is stable. So if we set that as the `value` prop, then consumers of
that context will _never_ need to re-render due to context changes (because it
will never change).

So rather than having one context provider, let's create two and put the `state`
into one and the `value` into the other.

ðŸ’° It'll look a bit like this:

```jsx
<StateContext.Provider value={state}>
  <DispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
    {children}
  </DispatchContext.Provider>
</StateContext.Provider>
```

### ðŸ’¯ moving async logic to the helper

What do we do when we find common chunks of code? We make a function out of it!
This next pattern is something I learned from Dan Abramov who said they do this
everywhere at Facebook. Basically, when you have a series of `dispatch` calls,
you can abstract that to a function which accepts the `dispatch` as an argument,
and calls it for you.

In this extra credit, we're also going to move the async logic to our reducer
which will allow us to support an optimistic UI experience.

For example:

```javascript
async function deleteContact(contactsDispatch, contact) {
  contactsDispatch({type: 'start delete', contact})
  try {
    const response = await contactsClient.deleteContact(contact)
    contactsDispatch({type: 'finish delete', contact})
    return response
  } catch (error) {
    contactsDispatch({type: 'fail delete', error, contact})
    return Promise.reject(error)
  }
}
```

Then someone could import that and use it in their component like so:

```javascript
import {deleteContact, useContactsDispatch} from '../context/contacts'

function Contact({contact}) {
  const dispatch = useContactsDispatch()
  function handleDeleteClick() {
    deleteContact(dispatch, contact)
  }

  return <div>Some awesome JSX here...</div>
}
```

When you're done, the `handleSubmit` should look like this:

```javascript
function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  updateUser(userDispatch, user, formState).catch(() => {
    /* ignore the error */
  })
}
```

And the click handler for the `reset` button should call
`userDispatch({type: 'reset'})` (so your reducer will need to support a `reset`
action). Also, this is just a refactor, so the tests should continue to pass
when you're done with this extra credit.

### ðŸ’¯ avoid unmount issues

> This extra credit is just for completeness, there's not really a "pattern"
> here necessarily, but you might find this interesting if you make it this far.

Imagine a scenario where the user clicks "Submit" and then navigates to another
page before the promise resolves. In this case our `UserProvider` component will
unmount, followed by the promise resolution which will call `dispatch` on a
component which has unmounted. This particular scenario is not a big deal
because it doesn't actually do anything, but it does log an annoying message to
the console and it'd be nice to avoid.

For this extra credit, update the `App` component to the following code and try
to click "submit" then quickly uncheck the checkbox and see the warning in the
console. Then see if you can fix the problem.

```javascript
function App() {
  const [showUserScreen, setShowUserScreen] = React.useState(true)
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        height: 350,
        width: 300,
        backgroundColor: '#ddd',
        borderRadius: 4,
        padding: 10,
      }}
    >
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={showUserScreen}
          onChange={e => setShowUserScreen(e.target.checked)}
        />{' '}
        show user screen
      </label>
      {showUserScreen ? (
        <UserProvider>
          <UserSettings />
          <UserDataDisplay />
        </UserProvider>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  )
}
```
